      "title": "Vintage Cork Map of Martha&#39;s Vineyard",
      "description": "This is a wonderfully unique vintage map of Martha&#39;s Vinyard, Massachusetts made out of cork and contrasted by a rich blue paper background. The piece is framed by a simple wooden frame.\n\nThe piece measures 14 inches high by 18 inches wide. The geographical elements are written in French, leading me to believe that this piece is French in origin.\n\nThe cork is meticulously layered and cut to form the geographical features of the islands six towns - Edgartown, Oak Bluffs, Vinyard Haven, Aquinnah, Chilmark and West Tisbury. Ocean depths are depicted with undulating white lines, and coastal and nautical features are listed.\n\nThis piece is estimated to be from the 1980s and is credited to Art & Marine BLX de L&#39;Isle. This would make a beautiful display piece as a ecologically friendly geographic statement.",

You can use the sheet of cardboard included in the package as an alternate support backing. The edges of the hand-cut cork sheet may not be perfectly smooth, but this will not show once framed.\n\nMORE DIY map kits: \nhttp:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/paperplaneprints\/search?search_query=diy+map+map\n\n** Please understand that I try to represent the actual colors as best as possible, but there may be some variation between my screen and yours.\n\nSHOP HOME: PaperPlanePrints.etsy.com",

Packages are sometimes delayed with the Post Office; this is out of my control. Design and shipping fees will not be refunded if the Post Office is delayed.\r\n\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; PAPER SIZE\r\n8x10 prints are printed on 8 1\/2 x 11 inch paper. To assist in matting the prints for larger frames (i.e. 11x14 inch mats with 8x10 inch windows), most 8x10s are not trimmed to exactly 8x10. If you know you will be using 8x10 frames, please let me know so that I can trim your prints to exactly 8x10 and save you the extra step.\r\n\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; PACKAGING\r\nItems are always shipped in well protected packaging.  Most 8x10s and smaller are shipped in rigid envelopes with stiff inserts. 11x14s and larger are generally shipped in tubes. Contact me if you need to know for sure for your specific order (as there are sometimes exceptions).   For tubes, there will be slight curling of the paper, but it is minimal due to the large width of the tube opening, and flattens quite easily. My tubes are super sturdy (they&#39;re practically uncrushable), and offer the best protection for your prints.\r\n\r\nWhenever possible, I use recycled materials -- it&#39;s more economical, and better for the environment.\r\n\r\nYOUR SHIPPING ADDRESS \r\nTo avoid delays, please make sure your Etsy and Paypal shipping addresses and names are current and accurate. Change them using the &quot;change&quot; or &quot;edit&quot; links when necessary.",
        "policy_refunds": "CANCELLATION OF CUSTOM ORDERS\r\n\r\nIf no proof has been sent yet, nor the paper print mailed, I will refund 100%. For all other cases, see below.\r\n\r\nCUSTOM DESIGNS: 100% refunds will NOT BE ISSUED ON CUSTOM DESIGNS.  A 50% design fee will be retained for items that have not been printed.  This means that you will only be returned 50% of your purchase price if you cancel an order for which I have previously sent you a work-in-progress draft or proof.  No refund will be given if the custom item has been shipped. This is because a large portion of the price you have paid is for the time I&#39;ve spent  creating a custom design just for you, and I cannot recoup time lost. \r\n\r\nPillows and canvas prints are not refundable.\r\n\r\nCUSTOM COLORS: A 25% design fee will be retained for artwork that I have recolored and sent proofs to you. In other words, if you requested a custom color for your item that wasn&#39;t already shown in the listing, and I have changed the colors for you and sent you proofs, you will only receive 75% of your purchase price. No refund will be given if custom-colored item has been shipped.\r\n\r\nCUSTOM DESIGNS AND COLORS THAT HAVE BEEN SHIPPED: \r\nIf I have already shipped the custom designed or custom colored item to you, there are no refunds. \r\n\r\nEXCHANGE \/\/ REPRINTS \/\/ COLOR MATCHING\r\nIf you need exact color tones, please order a color sample first. Screens and monitors all show colors differently. If you receive your prints and realize they are the wrong color tone, a reprint fee will be applied to cover my material and time costs. This fee may be 30 to 50% of the original purchase price. Originals must be returned to me in as good condition as I shipped them before replacements can be created.\r\n\r\nDIGITAL FILES\r\nDue to the nature of digital files, THERE WILL BE NO REFUNDS once a digital file has been emailed to you.  All refund policies above regarding custom work applies.\r\n\r\nUNFRAMED PRINTS\r\nPlease read the item descriptions. MOST OF MY PRINTS ARE UNFRAMED paper prints, always clearly stated in the item descriptions. The frames shown are for listing display purposes and are not included in the purchase price.\r\n\r\nRETURNS\r\nAll above conditions apply. For non-custom designs and colors, if you need to return your print I will accept a return if the item is returned in excellent condition (in its original packaging, with tracking and delivery confirmation for your protection). As I am a very small shop, SHIPPING COSTS ARE THE BUYER&#39;S RESPONSIBILITY, unless I am somehow at fault for the issue.\r\n\r\nPlease note: I CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT THE POST OFFICE WILL DELIVER ON TIME. Packages are sometimes delayed with the Post Office; this is out of my control. Design and shipping fees will not be refunded if the Post Office is delayed.  Please plan for potential shipping delays when ordering.\r\n\r\nPURCHASE WITH CONFIDENCE\r\nI have very high feedback and review ratings because I am committed to excellent service. Rest assured that I will do everything in my power to make sure you are happy with your purchase. Unexpected problems sometimes occur; please contact me so that we can work out a mutually beneficial solution.",
        "policy_additional": "DO YOU DO CUSTOM ORDERS?\r\nYES! I do custom (commissioned) orders. Just take a look around my shop and see what type of print you like. I can create a custom print for you based on the style(s) you select. My prices are affordable, but I can&#39;t give you a price quote until I know what your needs are. Full payment is required before design work begins. \r\n\r\nCAN YOU MAKE ME A MOCK-UP BEFORE I PURCHASE?\r\nUnfortunately, no. But I may be able to provide you with some extra examples before you purchase. Once your order is placed, I&#39;ll send you a proof before I ship it out. If the details you give me in your order are specific, I&#39;ll usually get it just right. Minor adjustments can be made free of charge. Read my customer reviews here: https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/PaperPlanePrints\/reviews\r\n\r\nCAN YOU CHANGE THE COLORS IN THIS PRINT?\r\nMost likely, yes. The listing description will tell you whether custom colors are acceptable. Custom color changes after two proofs may incur an additional design fee.\r\n\r\nCAN YOU MAKE THE MAP WITH MY CITIES?\r\nMost likely, yes. Most of my map listings are set up for you to customize without contacting me first. The specific cities and colors that you see are usually just examples. The listing description will tell you what is included, and you will write in your details in the checkout note box.\r\n\r\nCAN I SWAP OUT THE PRINTS IN THIS SET?\r\nMost likely, yes. But there may be an additional charge. Please contact me first to discuss your specific needs before placing your swap order.\r\n\r\nCAN I JUST ORDER THE DIGITAL FILE?\r\nMost custom maps can be ordered as digital files. Most nursery art prints cannot. I take digital file orders on a case-by-case basis.\r\n\r\nCAN YOU DONATE A PRINT?\r\nI currently donate to personal causes, and am unable to donate or otherwise participate other projects at this time.\r\n\r\nCAN I HAVE A REFUND?\r\nPlease see above section for conditions of canceled orders and returns.\r\n\r\nSHOP-TO-SHOP TRADES\r\nInterested in a trade?  If you&#39;re an Etsy seller with something you think I might like, and you see something in my shop that you like, LET&#39;S MAKE A DEAL!\r\n\r\nOTHER\r\nPlease contact me with ANY questions, concerns, or notifications.",
